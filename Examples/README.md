The Wisol WSSFM10R2 is a Sigfox Module based on [Onsemi AX-SFUS](http://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/AX-SFUS-D.PDF)

The WSSFM10R2 uses a UART interface. Simple commands are used to operate the module(see DataSheet).

This Board fits on Raspberry Pi 3, 2, B+, A+, Zero and Zero W.

Find on this repository the information about board. And some python examples to send information via Sigfox Network.
